This package installs Salt State files in /srv/salt for the purpose
of facilitating automation of cluster deployments at the SUSE Enterprise
Storage hands-on session at SUSEcon 2015.

NOTE: All of the following commands should be run on the Salt Master


Accept minion keys (once master and all minions are up and running):
===================================================================

# salt-key -A


Run arbitrary commands on all minions:
======================================

# salt '*' cmd.run '<CMD>'

E.g.:

smithfarm-adm:~ # salt '*' cmd.run 'zypper -n update'

NOTE: you can "watch" the update in real time by logging in to an instance
(e.g. at the web GUI console) and running 'top'


Reboot or poweroff all minions safely:
======================================

# salt '*' system.reboot
# salt '*' system.poweroff


Prepare cluster for ceph-deploy:
================================

This directory contains a collection of files that, if appropriately
installed on the Salt Master, will allow you to prepare the cluster for
ceph-deploy with a single command.

However, this functionality is still a Work In Progress.
